TODO:
NEEDED:
- Death Screen - add fade out when player clicks retry
- Implement fullscreen
- Implement frames per second
- Implement sounds
- Implement leaderboard, database for levels, timer?
- better level selector menu
- better settings menu
- Add weapons for player, attack by clicking mouse button in direction
- Add special abilities for player to pick up (extra health, double jump, bigger jump, etc)

CAN DO LATER:
- if item picked up, remove it from existing
- LEVELS ARE NOT BIGGER SCREEN FRIENDLY!!! FIND A DIFFERENT WAY TO BUILD THEM
- PRESS Q TO DROP ITEM (if player has an item in inventory), let player select item by pressing combination Q + 1, Q + 2, Q + 3. If player has no item, do nothing OR player selects item by pressing 1, 2 or 3, and then presses Q to drop

TESTING:
- Test playing a level, and then exiting to menu, and playing another level (if loads are good)
- Have 2 keys in inventory, unlock door -> it should take 1 key from the inventory
- have 2 doors and 1 key, unlock door -> it should take 1 key from the inventory and only 1 door should get unlocked
- have 2 doors and 2 keys, unlock door -> it should take 1 key from the inventory and only 1 door should get unlocked, then the other door should get unlocked

OPTIONAL:
- bug, if moving right, i press left, it moves left. if i move left, and i move right, it keeps going left
- add NPC of player, can interact, say some stuff? (starting level/tutorial can show things and explain)
- race level? side by side competition (like a boss level every 10 levels?)
- Player running animation?
- Add platform graphics
- Make door graphics a little darker
- Sort/make folders (mostly done)
- Better inventory graphics
- Better half heart graphic (show empty)
