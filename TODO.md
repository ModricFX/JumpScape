TODO:
NEEDED:
- PRESS Q TO DROP ITEM (if player has an item in inventory), let player select item by pressing combination Q + 1, Q + 2, Q + 3. If player has no item, do nothing (MAYBE BETTER: USER CLICKS 1, 2 OR 3 TO SELECT ITEM, AND Q DROPS)
- Add weapons for player, attack by clicking mouse button in direction
- Add special abilities for player to pick up (extra health, double jump, bigger jump, etc)

CAN DO LATER:
- LEVELS ARE NOT BIGGER SCREEN FRIENDLY!!! FIND A DIFFERENT WAY TO BUILD THEM

TESTING:
- Have 2 keys in inventory, unlock door -> it should take 1 key from the inventory
- have 2 doors and 1 key, unlock door -> it should take 1 key from the inventory and only 1 door should get unlocked
- have 2 doors and 2 keys, unlock door -> it should take 1 key from the inventory and only 1 door should get unlocked, then the other door should get unlocked

OPTIONAL:
- bug, if players goes up, so camera changes, the hearts have a moving animation (fixed itself??)
- bug, if moving right, i press left, it moves left. if i move left, and i move right, it keeps going left
- When player takes damage, throw him a little in a direction (not defined yet which direction)
- Player running animation?
- Add platform graphics
- Make door graphics a little darker
- Sort/make folders (mostly done)
- Better inventory graphics
- Better half heart graphic (show empty)
