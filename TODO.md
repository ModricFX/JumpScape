TODO:
NEEDED:
- PRESS Q TO DROP ITEM (if player has an item in inventory), let player select item by pressing combination Q + 1, Q + 2, Q + 3. If player has no item, do nothing OR player selects item by pressing 1, 2 or 3, and then presses Q to drop
- When player takes damage, throw him a little in a direction (not defined yet which direction) (game rule)
- Level start fade in (from black to game)
- Level end fade out (from game to black)
- Player death animation (rotate player 180 degrees, then fall down to ground)
- Add weapons for player, attack by clicking mouse button in direction
- Add ghost that follows player in path finding way
- Add special abilities for player to pick up (extra health, double jump, bigger jump, etc)

CAN DO LATER:
- if item picked up, remove it from existing
- LEVELS ARE NOT BIGGER SCREEN FRIENDLY!!! FIND A DIFFERENT WAY TO BUILD THEM

TESTING:
- Have 2 keys in inventory, unlock door -> it should take 1 key from the inventory
- have 2 doors and 1 key, unlock door -> it should take 1 key from the inventory and only 1 door should get unlocked
- have 2 doors and 2 keys, unlock door -> it should take 1 key from the inventory and only 1 door should get unlocked, then the other door should get unlocked

- Player running animation?
- Add platform graphics
- Make door graphics a little darker
- Sort/make folders (mostly done)
- Better inventory graphics
